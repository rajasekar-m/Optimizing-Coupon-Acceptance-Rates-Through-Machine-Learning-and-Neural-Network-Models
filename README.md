# Optimizing-Coupon-Acceptance-Rates-Through-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Network-Models
Understanding which users are likely to accept a coupon helps optimize marketing spend and user engagement.

The dataset was preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling
numerical features. Multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
were trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Separately, an Artificial Neural Network was built
using Keras with ReLU activations, dropout layers, and a sigmoid output layer. Model performances were evaluated.

While classical models like XGBoost delivered strong baseline result high accuracy of 90%, the neural
network model outperformed them slightly, especially in recall and ROC-AUC. This project demonstrates the im-
portance of testing multiple modeling strategies and highlights the potential of ANN in extracting deeper behavioral
patterns for marketing optimization.
